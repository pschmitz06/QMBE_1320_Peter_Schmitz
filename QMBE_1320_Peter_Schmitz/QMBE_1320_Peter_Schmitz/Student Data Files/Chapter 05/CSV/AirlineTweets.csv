1,I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help!
2,my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What's the process for damage reimbursement?
3,agent rudely tells me You're not going 2 CABO today or manana back 2 PHX flew @USAirways
4,suggestion- shades on the windows @KCIAirport so travelers won't have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around
5,RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw.
6,had a very rude gate agent at BWI tonight gate B8 after a 6.5hr delay for flight 1172. I think a little training is in order.
7,"when I corrected the attendants error she gave me attitude made a rude show of taking back nuts&amp; said ""well i was Late Flight"""
8,Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! http://t.co/5tXU5tSFkJ
9,bag in possession but no clothes in bag??
10,after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. 
11,everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher like I want to fly w/them again!
12,neveryamind I paid $450 for a flight. 250 for a new bag is easy for business class customers right? http://t.co/vn3JJIa53O
13,Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6
14,No. We were in a large group. Majority of the 30+ bags were soaked.
15,thanks for taking such good care of my luggage.
16,has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again.
17,Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy
18,the agents werenot helpful told me I would have to pay 2chng even though I Tld them going2 bwi whch is part of trvl advsry
19,according to the flight attendant my husband doesn't talk english when the fact is that he understand and talks it
20,Your staff was really kind about the flight delay. Luggage? Not at all. Very disappointing.
21,because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
22,almost bumped me off my flight to HRL when I was 20 minutes early then your staff was rude when I asked what was the problem?
23,nothing express about your express bag drop at Phoenix Sky Harbor
24,I'm sorry for straying and going with @AmericanAir I've learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness!
25,your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
26,a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.
27,currently as im bringing my 3 year old to the bathroom I'm being rushed by the flight attendant.
28,our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear ripped seam snow soaked busted zippers 
29,we didn't nothing was ruined just wet. Just frustrating when after traveling for 12 hours you can't change into clean clothes
30,weather delays aren't your fault today but getting to hotel with two soaked suitcases and no dry clothes stinks frustrated
31,Had a bad experience with them last week.  They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla.  Why?
32,are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I'm on...
33,then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal
34,where your airline people screwed up our boarding passes on the way back from puerto Vallarta. This is horrible and we are
35,my bday was yesterday and my girl gave birth to my first born and I couldn't get a courtesy flight change from Lynn... THANKS!
36,"Paid for early bird boarding and got B46.  I said to lady ""well  that system is about dead."" She didn't understand"
